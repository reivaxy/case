# case
Just a case, with a cover, some holes...

I needed a case for a static relay to commute lights for a recifal aquariums.

Before that I was using a power socket with embedded timer that was supposed to mecanically switch on and off the lights,
but the high power LEDs were probacly demanding high currents, resulting in a spark beween the contacts for the switch, 
which would remain stuck. And often the lights would not go off, which can result in burning the corals.

A static relay is totally electronic, there is no mobile contacts, no spark.

Here is it in the resulting box, with the hote for the low tension alimentation, one hole for power-in wire, and 2 holes 
for power out wires.

2,9mm scews are a perfect fit for the cover

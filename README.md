# case
Just a case, with a cover, some holes...

I needed a case for a static relay to commute lights for a recifal aquariums.

Before that I was using a power socket with embedded timer that was supposed to mecanically switch on and off the lights,
but the high power LEDs were probacly demanding high currents, resulting in a spark beween the contacts for the switch, 
which would remain stuck. And often the lights would not go off, which can result in burning the corals.

A static relay is totally electronic, there is no mobile contacts, no spark.

Here is the design:

Here is the printed object with the relay (this one is not yet wired), with the hole for the low tension alimentation, one hole for power-in wire, and 2 holes 
for power out wires.

2,9mm scews are a perfect fit for the cover
